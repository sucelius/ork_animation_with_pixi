# Ork animation with Pixi.js and Spine 

This project is developed in Javascript with a focus on PIXI.js library and the use of 2D animations from Spine. In this application, you can control an orc who can walk, run, and cast a spell known as "Razlom". 

PIXI.js is a powerful 2D rendering engine for WebGL and Canvas, which makes it perfect for creating games and interactive applications. This library provides easy-to-use APIs to create graphics, handle user interactions, and implement animations, which makes it an ideal choice for developing games and other interactive applications.

In this project, I integrated a ready-made Spine animation using the npm library pixi-spine. Pixi-spine is a library that simplifies the integration of Spine animations into PIXI.js applications. I was able to easily load and control the Spine animation using the pixi-spine library, which helped me to create an interactive prototype with smooth 2D animations.

Overall, this project is an example of how to use PIXI.js and Spine to create interactive applications with smooth 2D animations
